# P2Pcom
A peer to peer communication system for devices on the same network


## Disclaimer
***P2Pcom does not encrypt messages in a cryptographically secure way in all cases. It is just a proof of concept. Do not use P2Pcom for any important applications.***

## About P2Pcom
P2Pcom was created as a way to learn more about networking and communication between computers. In future I plan to add communication between devices on more than just the same network.


## How to use
1. Add username to the config file under 'USER_NAME'
2. Generate keys using the generate_key.py script
